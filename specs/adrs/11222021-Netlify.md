# We are now using Netlify instead of Azure

* Status: Accepted

* Date: 11-22-2021

## Background
We were using Azure as our deployment and hosting method.
This unfortunately did not work well, and we kept experiencing issues with CSS and JS not working properly in the hosted site.
This pushed us to find another hosting solution.

## Decision drivers
The need for a reliable hosting platform
Azure not working as we expected

## Decision
We will be moving to hosting on Netlify instead of Azure.
This is expected to give us more reliable performance.
