# Local storage

* Status: accepted

* Date: 2021-11-05

## Background
We researched database and local storage options for use in Javascript

## Decision drivers
We are fully aware that we have a limited amount of development capability, and it is important to focus on core features that must be developed

## Decision
We decided to start with local storage in Javascript because it is viable and takes less work than communicating with a database. A database can be added if it is necessary.
