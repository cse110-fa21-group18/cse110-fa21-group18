2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
Slack is the first and primary means of communication between group members. Everyone should have
Slack installed on their phone, and make a best effort to reply to messages as soon as seeing it. Replying
“I have seen your message, but I’m out now and will reply in detail later” is always preferable to not
replying at all. In general, a team member should at the very least respond to slack messages within 12
hours, and preferably within 3 hours.
Github is another important means of communication. Each team member is expected to be aware of any
changes to the Github repository within 12 hours. For example, if an issue was raised in the repository on
Monday night, everyone should be entirely aware of the issue in a meeting on Tuesday.
Additionally, each team member is required to come to all-hands Zoom meetings. If someone cannot
make a meeting due to unresolvable time conflicts, they should notify all other team members in writing
through Slack.
3) Scheduling Meetings
Three type of meetings
a) Discussion sessions:
- Monday 4-5pm, mandatory for group leads
- Other group members attend on rotational basis
b) Standup meetings:
- Remote (Preferred Mon-Wed)
- Meet with TA
- All team members are expected
- Leads need to send out when2meet to figure out a suitable time
c) Group meetings:
- Internal team meetings
- Maximum participation is highly recommended!
- To discuss project work
- To work on group assignments
- Talk about the meeting time on Slack
4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members
Team members should treat each other with respect and professionalism at all times. As a general rule,
each team member has the responsibility to treat others as nicely as possible. Team members are
expected to either attend group meetings, or excuse themselves with a group leader beforehand.
5) Conflict Resolution
Each team member should actively identify conflicts and call out conflicts without escalating it. For
example, a team member is expected to acknowledge a difference in opinion: “A wants to design the
navbar as such, but B wants to do a more transparent design instead.”
After identifying the conflict, team members are expected to acknowledge each other’s viewpoints and
participate in a respectful and on-topic discussion to efficiently reach a consensus.
