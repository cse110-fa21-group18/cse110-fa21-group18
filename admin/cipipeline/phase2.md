For phase 2 of the pipeline we have implemented code coverage reports, minification, and packaging. As such, the site will deploy to netlify with the minifications. For packaging, we made it so once a pull request is created and is manually reviewed, we will update the version number in the package.json and merge to main. That way, we published an updated package of our code with fixes. In our workflows, we have 2 yml files. The yml file named azure runs for pushes to dev branches, there, jsdoc generation, jest tests, code checking and linting all occur. Then it passes the tests, a pull request is created in which netlifyBuildDeploy runs, after manually reviewing and with the automated testing, it is merged onto main, where the netlify site is updated alongside a new package.
