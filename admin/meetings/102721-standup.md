Brainstorming Review
We will need to focus on:
User personas - filtering out the users
Who should be our users? Since we will need to really focus on them as we won’t have too much time to implement features
Theme of the app
Focuses on a subset of problems
Ex: recipe management app, can't be too simple but needs to right balance of features, have some unique features
Finalizing the mindmap
What’s gonna be final, design decisions
Know our limitations
Our tasks
Filter users, feature balance
Include 2 domain-specific features
Quantify risks of our features
Ex: voice command, TTS
Integrating a 3rd party API, the risks?
May not work all the time, malfunction
Integration issues
Inexperience, setting up
Project Roadmap
Our goals to get to the MVP
Just an approximate plan, they may change, high level
