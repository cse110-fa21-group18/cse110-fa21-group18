## Agenda
- Purpose: to go over work accomplishment and not to criticize or correct the agile process
- In preparation: everyone should make a list of what they've accomplished, what's a current work in progress, and anything you'll be starting on in the next week. Please prepare demos or whatever you want to present for the meeting tomorrow. We'll record the meeting to gather demo videos and screenshots that way.
