## TODOS/REMINDERS:
Write all tasks from wireframes
CRUD features and MVP should be done(fully functional) by NOV 22 
Create github project boarD
Testing is important -> Lab 8 important to learning how to test 



## SUMMARY:
* Discussing current progress 
    We will no longer be using svelte
    Project is intended to just be HTML, CSS, JS
    We are allowed to use Bootstrap for styling, but not allowed to use frameworks for js
    The idea is to learn how to write js on our own which is why no frameworks for js are allowed
    Data will be stored in Local Storage
* Who is doing what?
    * Group division can be seen on Miro Board
    * Will distribute work starting tomorrow (11/10)
        * UI Templates (frontend)
            * Wireframes -> Screens that look like wireframe with HTML/CSS
            * #1 Create tasks from each wireframe and the components that are a part of each wireframe
            * Subteams(pairs) should have a specific task that maps to a function
        * Backend
            * Subteams(pairs) should have a specific task that maps to a function
            * Ex. Going through spoonacular API -> How does the API work? How does the I/O work?
            * Reading/learning about local storage
    * Recommended strategy is paired programming
* Github project board
    * Create project under Projects tab and then create tasks there

* Important to document everything that we do because our grade will also be based on the process of creating our project 
* Make sure to keep up with the stand-ups -> each individual must update whether explaining what you have done or that you weren’t able to work on the project.
* CRUD features and MVP should be done(fully functional) by NOV 22
